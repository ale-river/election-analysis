# **Election_Analysis**

## ***Project Overview***
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidates won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.


## ***Resources***
- Data Sources: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2

## ***Summary***
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were "x" votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette

## ***Challenge Overview***
The module helped to undertand the coding blocks by describing the qualities of each topic. However, the complexity was high level which encourage to study the semantic of program.

## ***Challenge Summary***
Open files, create variables and connect them through for loops and other conditionals, are tools that require practice while using Python in a IDE.
